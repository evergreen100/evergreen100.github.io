I am a Ph.D student in the Environmental Science program at Indiana University. My multidisciplinary research blends physiological methods, ground observations, spatial analysis, remote sensing, and terrestrial modeling to unravel climate change effects, especially extreme events, on terrestrial vegetation. My research program is organized around two primary goals: 1. Employ interdisciplinary approaches to improve our understanding of how terrestrial vegetation responds to climate change and extreme events, such as drought, at the organ, canopy structural, and ecosystem functional levels. 2. Develop predictive systems aiming at forecasting future ecosystem conditions, enhancing terrestrial productivity, and optimizing carbon sequestration.
